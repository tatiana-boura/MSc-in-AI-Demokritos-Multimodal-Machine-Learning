Rev. Gary Davis playing 'Candyman',putting some variations into this key of C and let's take the tune Candyman we heard Reverend Davis play this at the beginning of this video he just played an instrumental version let me just run through it real quick and sing it the way he used to sing it now you play this as if a woman and a man was singing so I'm going to imitate the woman's voice and I'm going to imitate the man's voice don't get worried about this and let's hear what happened it's a lovely guitar arrangement which will be discussing I'll be teaching at the Reverend Davis said he learned this 1905 the Carolinas guitar play cold water urban I came to his town singing this that's the woman singing never meaning God give anything in a God of my the world see Mike and Amanda but did you get did you get to me running at the pitch you get the baby some running in the beach run let me get the do anything in a catamite a world i can demand all right let's pick it on that guitar now Reverend Davis used to call this style of playing old-fashioned picking I guess that was because it came about at the turn of the century he sort of looked down his nose at it saying that that's the way the old-fashioned plays would play guitar and he would play much fancier much more complicated and indeed he did but this way of playing guitar really has a lot of charm and I'm fascinated by it as I hope you are let's take a look at Candyman there's a couple of lovely tricks to this we're in the key of C we have our pinkie with the C chord on the third fret of the first string but our middle finger is going to be traveling down to the second fret of the third string we'll have this phrase travels down then it goes back home it's very important to me that that middle thing goes back to the second fret of the fourth string get back into it's C chord and back down to the second fret of the third string now Reverend Davis only used two fingers as I mentioned so I'll be playing this with two fingers every once in a while a little help from my middle finger you see what's comfortable for you take a look at the tablature again there's nothing difficult about the chord positions we just have to sing the F and a gene forward so I think we'll be ready now to split the screen and we'll play it slowly together and then we'll bring it up to tempo you ready let's split that screen start off with a C chord without taking every take that thing y'all a g7 chord see Cole but then he now what without the watch out I'm f---ing my secret there Oh make sure your middle fingers going back home and you can play around with this arrangement let's see what I can do you here we go gonna hammer into this you let me do a variation for that we bring it up to ten throwing in everything I can one more time

Red leaves on the river   Footprints in the sand   Cold walk in December,warming up your hands   Sun dress on the front steps   Sun up by the lake   Blanket down in the backyard   Lyin' wide awake   Yeah, that's a memoryI don't mess with   The girl I was the best with   The one I was obsessed with   Girl, you just don't get it   I'd fall right back with one slip   Always leave me helpless   Don't hate me, I can't help it   Gotta leave us where we left it   Your memory I don't mess with   Moonlight on the back seat   Breeze through the wires   Springsteen on my speakers   Girl, I'm on fire   And that stuff I don't think about   'Cause it still kills me now   I still can't dance around   That memory I don't mess with   The girl I was the best with   The one I was obsessed with   Girl, you just don't get it   I'd fall right back with one slip   Always leave me helpless   Don't hate me I can't help it   Gotta leave us where we left it   Your memory I don't mess with   It's good running into you like this   Girl, I'm close as I can get   It's your memory I don't mess with   The girl I was the best with   The one I was obsessed with   Girl, You just don't get it   I'd fall right back with one slip   Always leave me helpless   Don't hate me I can't help it   Gotta leave us where we left it   Your memory I don't mess with   Oooh  - Yeah. Oh man, some of my favoritememories are sitting around a fire playing songs, you know by all my favorite artists growing up. Willie Nelson, Hank Jr. Garth Brooks, Vince Gill. So this is really cool. What a cool thing to be a part of. So uh, let's see here. So we've been home for awhile, not on the road as much. And so this next songwas one of the first kind of big songs we had in our career. And uh, and it still means the same thing, just it's got a littledifferent approach to it. I think my wife is probably like: ""Hey so when are you gettingback on the road again?"" Cause I'd been home every day,all the time, up in her hair. She's probably like: ""All right, get back on that road and start playing some more music."" So here's the one that y'all might know. Thank y'all again for hangin'. It's called 'Hard to Love'.  Do do do do do   Do do do do do, yeah   I am insensitive   I have a tendency topay more attention   to the things that I need.   Sometimes I drink too much   Sometimes I test your trust   Sometimes I don't knowwhy you stay with me   I'm hard to love, hard to love   Oh, I don't make it easy   I couldn't do it if Istood where you stood   I'm hard to love, hard to love   You say that you need me   Well, I don't deserve it   But I love that you love me good, yeah   Yeah, you love me good   Yes, she does   Well, I am a short fuse   I am a wrecking ball   Crashing into your heart like I do   But you're like a Sunday morning   Full of grace and full of Jesus   And I wish that Icould be more like you   I'm hard to love, hard to love,   Oh I don't make it easy   I couldn't do it if Istood where you stood   I'm hard to love, hard to love   You say that you need me   Well, I don't deserve it   But I love that you love me good   Yeah you love me good, baby   'Cause girl you've givenme a million second chances   And I don't ever wannatake you for granted   I'm just a man   I'm just a man   Hard to love, hard to love   Oh, I don't make it easy   I couldn't do it if Istood where you stood   I'm hard to love, hard to love   You say that you need me   Well, I don't deserve it   But I love that you love me   I don't make it easy   I couldn't do it if Istood where you stood   I'm hard to love, hard to love   You say that you need me   Well, I don't deserve it   But I love that you love me good, baby   Yeah you love me good   Yeah you love me good, baby   Yeah you love me good, yeah  - 0h yeah Man! The quiet. You know, it's been kindaweird singing to cameras instead of to livepeople through this time. It's been, you know, youhad something to get used to but this is kind of adifferent kind of quiet. This is kind of the quietthat I was used to, you know?

strength of my arms to hold your clothes and say oh i kept my eyes closed i never know where the shadows are these days i stood in the room of a house divided but it washed away from me they washed away from me oh how it washed away from me it was the way to take how the maid  [Applause] and i am repeating the way that i was when i used to know    there is no one who will take me by that shore

love you so much i thoughts  [Applause] there is no one who will take me by that shore but the waves all over your eyes the storm is nearly over nearly over and you can take away the divine man here

would survive the flood with mighty flowers and our blood pretended that we don't know   we gave away our hearts before we knew what they were what a pretty far we didn't even know  [Applause]  we gave away our hearts before we knew what they  [Applause]   [Applause] oh   call this on my awful lot skies they opened wide for us oh what a heavy rain it was covered  but i know just what good it was too but to call those shadows coming after you go go on i couldn't pay to lose  let them know  the visions of the things i'd done i wouldn't be the only one if you'd only told the truth while they chased you down that night i was pulling feathers from your life i swear i saw it in your eyes you never told the truth but to hold those shadows coming after you   i couldn't stand to lose  now    [Applause]  i couldn't beg you to [Applause] i couldn't stand to lose   [Applause] be true i'll be gone you're only for yourself  but the shadow is yours  might realize that there is  but the shadow  is you can't run away when you know that the tall tall shadow is yours [Applause]  [Laughter] now there is   is   [Applause]   shadow is yours  you can't run away if the shadow is  sometime now i've been dividing the end of the snow  sometime now i've been afraid that the pilgrimage violence finally coming to take me i have been one of them away i have been one of them  never looks down by the maple  goes never looks down if he goes  crossing down on your cheek and tomorrow i know by the rubies in your voice they've been calling your name to me lame you have one of them waiting   if you go have a look  [Applause]  [Applause]    finally   never if down       uh [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]   all fables fail you when you're older and still the mirror on your wall keeps you from staring into the darkness and vision's keeping you awake in fairy tales you try to stay they echo back and you like a car race when you're still too young to know you've been living for a goal spinning fables where the brightest colors fading  but my love for you is bold take it all  i found my old friends back at home and for my father i had all the answers paid a price for pretending heroes and villains i had made they're all i have left of my day in one more page of underwritten endings am i still too young to know i've been living for ghosts in my mind the brightest colors are unfading stories fail you when you're grown don't believe them anymore my love for you is bold but it won't save you my love for you is bold but it won't change you my love for you is bold take it all how long can i keep going stories of toads still can't save my love how do i be how do i be bold  stories i've been told can't save you from it all [Applause]   forget where you have been why can't i look away from the face i've seen inside on those days we spent in the park saw you chase your dreams now the vulvar and that's  forgiven how long i'd let you stand  i can't escape my name and i don't even try when my body's tired of drinking bitter white when the cup it breaks in my hand each time now the carpet breaks in my hand each time telling me you're wrong for giving it took me is to say it all already  but i know you're already forgiven  i took up the pieces of what you  it takes me years  it takes me years  don't wait for a fortune don't wait for the fall i've been there before you i  sing it to the dark i'm at the end of the world another end of the world love is love  fall apart when is fall into me find me at the end of the world  writing from your future see it from the start casting this all for you glitter in the yard you could keep on running  another end of the world   that to me love is   [Laughter]  waiting there for you  [Applause]

know those of you were interested in a bunch of guitar you might like it anyway this is this is a piece from it this is called Bardot Rush  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]              [Applause]  I have a little problem with the way I've got these these are monitors this not hearing aid appearances this is these things let us hear what you're hearing basically from this angle so but mine are cutting out constantly and I look more than there in actually it's a problem so we might have to do something about that right now I just take one and about receives that helps  this is John Aaron Coburn's [Applause]  sorry John what did you say if we need to change the frequencies maybe we should do that yeah probably good pardon the interruption here we just put if we can fix this right now could be better for the whole evening if we can't well you know we're just carrying on still be okay for you let's get it there with us for a minute here I gotta say it's nice to be back here with all your breasts something when this isn't working and I can't hear anything at all because these things you're plugging my ears this way at least I you know it's like being in a room with you people strangely  [Applause]  so I don't know it may turn out that this John Erickson here working on the machinery and I suppose mixing the sound that you're hearing you don't like what you're hearing something they have not me but in any case would hopefully would get this fixed and very quickly thank you for observing that my mother made this shirt about 35 years ago Thanks  I never knew there was this much choreography involved in a show like this  yeah still doing it so something else there's like a ton of RF would come through this pissy RF and then it cuts out a billion it wasn't doing it when we did sound change this afternoon it was perfectly fine so I don't know maybe something he just brought was here right all that energy has to go somewhere anyway I think we should carry on   and the thing about this is my nephew yes this is rare we have a chance to just sort of converse like visit as I confess that I can't really see you very well in the lights here you're kind of a dark pit full of energy and voices this is it feels good to say and you're still alive since both of us ours is a good thing  yeah we can pretend this the end of the show and you can sort of holler no title since I don't know if we're going to do them you're right I didn't bring my buddy I have osteopenia and I'm not allowed to fall so I can't ride my bike in a harness it pisses me off actually but it's a fact of life yes we'll get there once we get to be able to do anything I'll get there too there'll be you know you're gonna hear a mixture of things but momentarily John gets back to the soundboard we'll be able to see it especially carry on like that you know there's my dulcet tones okay [Applause]  so far so good  [Applause] slid out of our dreams like a baby out of yours hands on

Bironas using all the time austrian drag scared passes mustache floor last night's pharmacy benefits all tattoos and metal bits and in the other corner wearing white trunks today's tourists already

together  of the river  and real place  shudders   using the spaces between the first revision     I learned as a child not just we are gonna be  what   I see the that is hard  [Applause]  I do   [Applause] I wrote that song in the run-up to y2k we were all waiting for the planes to follow the sky no more Facebook it where's that when you need it  I played a gig in Toronto an outdoor show a New Year's Eve 2000 or other other acts on the bill that been tagged let's forget what it was about it was about y2k it was a big fancy if you're not busy hiding come to our show so it was freezing it's really brutal  if it were MC during the practice with fur on the face and and the wind was coming off Lake Ontario it was bitter and to top it off three little twelve-year-old boys ran by and from the station through bolts at us they thought they were really cool I'm sure they work well the whole thing was cool but it was annoying they didn't do it for a long weekend did it and ran away before somebody stopped them but never frozen boats [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]  I overhear you in here that's the size somebody makes when again people actively training during the zombie  proneural and the tortoises train  [Applause]  [Applause] but if you were a child  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause] [Applause]  everyone somebody else [Applause] [Applause]  anyone can die here to an everyday it doesn't take much effort though it goes against the grain  those are sweets the landscape like that [Applause]  [Applause]  I see a dark brick shines like Starling [Applause] College shines like glass shards of dark hair the mud every shadow trying [Applause] pleasure  [Applause] compassion cancer  summer powers  the night [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause] [Applause] [Applause]   [Applause]  [Applause]  somebody pointed out at one time that's how in the 70s when they the first albums were coming out there was a whole lot of sunlight yeah some real dance that kind of representative of the general tone of things general not exclusively that but but somewhere in there there was a shift and after that there was a whole lot of light in the songs and which isn't necessarily to say that you know that things got darker figured the sentence but but I don't know I've always been kind of fascinated with it with a look of late at night the gleam of streetlights and

brightness sky    [Applause] thanks very much I do one more solder than take a break saw as a little bit distinct from most of my stuff because it was written at the invitation of someone else I'm generally not inclined to write that way I kind of sit around waiting for the good idea and try to grab it and wrestle with it when it comes so you know I used to writing on demand but in this case the invitation came from some people who were making a documentary film on Toronto about the length of times of the late Canadian poet Alfred II it was a brilliant and an interesting character and although I never met him when he was alive he died in about 2000 but it was a great honor to be asked I thought felt to be asked to contribute something to this film and so I said yes and without actually having any clearer idea for what that meant as I hope I'm right about this but and I had some you know there were things I didn't want to do I didn't I didn't want to write a song as if I were Alfred II because I never met him and I didn't wanna write a song about Alfred II you know like I offered ELP writing through the glass sometimes English ballad about a birdie appropriate and although we very might have liked that but so I was kind of wondering what how I would approach this and an image came into my mind of as older homeless guy was obsessed with the poetry of l30 and stands there on the street with his coattails flapping in his ear blowin in the wind and he's ranching the poetry of Alberta at passers-by so the first person voice in the song was that guy   [Applause]  instead the swaying boxcar doorway moving east away from the sunset and after a while the other is digesting country and the belly perceives a map beggars vision dust and dirt on the face

the instance of everything that exchanges itself for words and became another opinion we chanted the spell of minions and we said Mountain regardless from enemies  and we said what it's in the gods themselves you dream them but they had dreamed us in from there and they spoke to us from the Florence and the mouths of the overrated dance teacher and the speech words  our children   [Applause]

ignites and there's a story they're projected by the Outland to find out what it is but but uh the somebody in the in a preview of the show we did the other night Minh in near in the Philadelphia area wrote it wrote the title of the album is igniting crows had the plot of that it's actually kind of an interesting image but not what I think I want to own but with anyway crowing eight nights has to do with the the Coburn family and the family motto would history and stuff like that but this is a piece from that another one and this was written on Martin Luther King Day this year and because it was Martin Luther King Day and because of the kind of the feel of the beasts seemed appropriate to reference him in the title of its own it's called April in Memphis  [Applause]  [Applause]

Murray McLauchlan - A Thomson Day (for Tom Thomson) - Official Music Video,"[81 BPM folk guitar]  I was standing by 'The West Wind'  Standing there amazed  At how the whitecaps rolled  And the pine trees swayed  And it moved me in a way  I can't find the words to say  It was a Thomson day  Sometimes I forget the world of people and things  And get lost in a place  Where wildness is king  Let the waves roll  Soothe my soul  While the west wind blows  Every fish that's in the water  Every eagle in the sky  Flying high  Every tree and every dragonfly  Says, ""I'm alive!""  I may not be here forever  But I'm here today  That's okay  It's nature's way  But at this very moment I am carried away  In a Thomson day  In a Thomson day  In a Thomson day "

INGLORIOUS - BURN (Deep Purple Live Cover),"- I think Burn is one of thehigh points of Purple's career. It's a terrific piece of work. It owes some of its thought and structure to Highway Star in that, again, I think we wanted it tobe an opening number, number that you could burstonto stage and start with. It has structured organsolos and guitar solo much in the style of Highway Star. Structured around a Bach like sequence, pre-written by Ritchieand me for our own bits. You know, so it hassimilarities with Highway Star. But I mean, what a beaut. The lyric content Icould sort of do without, but I preferred the lyriccontent of Highway Star. I really rather wish thatone part of it didn't say, ""Couldn't believe she was devil's sperm,"" and that does worry me slightly 'cause I'm not quite sure what that is. But you can't take awaythe brilliance of the song, the track as it stands. It's a great piece of work. (high-energy rock music begins)  The sky is red, I don't understand   Past midnight I still see the land   People are sayin' the woman is damned   She makes you burnwith a wave of her hand   The city's a blaze, the town's on fire   The woman's flames are reaching higher   We were fools, we called her liar   All I hear is Burn  (high-energy rock music continues)  I didn't believe she was devil's sperm   She said curse youall, you'll never learn   When I leave there's no return   The people laughed till she said Burn   Warning came, no one cared   Earth was shakin', we stood and stared   When it came no one was spared   Still I hear Burn  (high-energy rock music continues)  You know we had no time   We could not even try   You know we had no time  (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues)  You know we had no time   We could not even try   You know we could not   You know we had no time  (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues) (high-energy rock music continues)  The sky is red, I don't understand   Past midnight I still see the land   People are sayin' the woman is damned   She makes you burnwith a wave of her hand   Warning came, no one cared   Earth was shakin, we stood and stared   When it came no one was spared   Still I hear Burn  (audience applauds) - [David] Thank you."
Inglorious - Unaware (Official _ Studio Album _ 2016),I'm tall like a face me boy I'm andreas knife failings guitar and well wagons are unfilled and I play drums my name is Nathan and I'm the lead singer the thing I'm most proud of I start first big with its until I die it's great introduction to the band what we are great opener to the album as well I gotta know know I think the found influence is a Led Zeppelin Whitesnake be purple Aerosmith thank the boys but main influence so the writing process was very new to me night of center lyrics on the whole album he's written and this is like a first a first go play which is it's amazing it really is because they know I found it so easy to dispose your guys because we're all very honest to each other sometimes a little too honest living you know if something doesn't work we're not precious everyone can write everybody can play guitar everybody can play drums you know everybody could sing cases wail and toss everything at home setting of ideas it's already cool rare bit different it won't I guess my favorite toy holy water we didn't want to overdo it on the harmonies on the album but there's moments where like in holy water which is trapped for everyone is singing at that corner it sounds like a choir it sounds absolutely incredible those are things that I think I'm most proud of both me and wheeler a finger-like lead guitarist playing solo sonic no pick for me on that one's a lot of fun doing the marking off the thing and yes it's a great tool it's a cool the thing I found most hard was finding a nice guitar friend he's for sure one of the best singers I've ever heard and especially when you have loud it's incredible Andreas is the ultimate lead guitar player we're like twins with six foot two blond guys but we'll so great guitar player it's a lot of fun having him in the band great to have somebody you can do everything with I would ensure first within being a sweet he'd understand mine or the sense of humor but he's just as disgusting as I am so that's cool you know we have a lot of fun together for sure all the other guys are said on it yeah we personally have not played with it Cooper does because it is it our favorite song well you reckon warning I think warning it's what most enemies we thought we were recording demos so we went it's in the middle of nowhere you recorded the album at a place called Liston Park studios beautiful place middle of nowhere not really anything going on the fact that it was so natural we didn't even realize we were recording them it's slow it's more organic it's more energetic thing than what I've ever been a pilot before so that's so cool to have everybody in the same room in the recording studio recording like be perfectly lives according live and not to click tracks so yeah the tempo is change and there's a few sweet notes and everything is not perfect at the end of the day that's what the album's that we love a life and I think that's all that matters and we will sound exactly like that like what they're hearing that we grew my favorite song has got to be a glorious the middle section was basically improvised we were just sort of jamming that that whole section out it goes very 70s and psychedelic in the middle section that was co-written with a really wonderful writing team Neil Faircloth is the current bass player in the Queen here's a wonderful sister Louis and whose brother than all John Wagner and they are without doubt some of the nicest people I've ever met great writers we had a real good time writing that song together got to exercise some chops which is pretty cool nothing feels more exciting than when I'm singing be details with this band nothing they don't come much better at mixing than John Mitchell who is a guitar supremo and insane songwriter he co-wrote unaware with myself and Colleen my favorite song on the album is in Maine so love unaware it was quite different actually when we Mesa turned up and we just turned the riff on its head you know it's an improvised solo it's not knowing too much beforehand you play what what feels natural in that moment that particular moment it's the first song I believe that nature sent away it would be amazing to meet these people that we've been seeing on Twitter and seeing Facebook that have commented on our videos and said oh my god I love you guys and that's justice by cover albeit covers of some of the vessels on the rim but still nice six sightings be able to share with them iron music and see them at shows and meetings people within Sookie that's even getting record bill I think I just care about people that like it because those are the same people is the people that like the same musical interests is this people the same tastes and the people that grew up in the same albums that we've is rock is definitely not dead and I'm not saying we're flying the flag or winter saviors but we're going to do whatever we can to let people make

Royal Bliss - Drown With Me,"- We're with Royal Blissfrom Salt Lake City, Utah. Known them for years and years but I've never actually been able to work on a song with them. - We kind of came up with theidea maybe about a week ago. It was so new and fresh to us that sometimes those new and fresh songs are the most fun. - It's our first time actuallywriting with the Sean, our new guitar player. It definitely added a lot. - Got it to a point now whereit's like Joel's just like, ""Yeah maybe take out thatpart, get that extra memory."" And that's what coming toa producer's all about. - I actually think we changed a lot on it, but changed for the better. - Everything is apleasurable experience here because it's just, it's a house of music. It's easy, there's no tension. - They're seasoned musiciansand they're all really good and they don't take a bunch of doctoring and things the way that alot of bands do these days.

THE NEW ROSES - Dead Man's Voice (Official Video) _ Napalm Records,first track to me Ed's or tails tell me about it why did you choose this track to be the first one on the record just good question because it's so easy to answer heads or tails is the perfect opener because it really shows the rock and roll vibes that we have before we get on stage it's all about like warming up and you want to go out and do something crazy and it also really shows what we experienced on towards up and down all the time you feel like the king of the world and the next moment you feel like like nothing like you just want to go home and quit music forever so it is that vibe we have all the time on tour and we want to share this with with the audience and I think it's a good way to start this journey of the record so it was a very easy pick for us makes me want to get a little bit crazy tonight you can always can then you're in the right place you they're back again with a couple of beers cheers talk about the next time on the track thirsty and this is one of my favorites on the new album cool and then when do you come up with his son actually it was the very last song that we added to the record i had the idea on a festival we played this summer and i played the rift just for guitar sound check and herbs and hey stop what's that that is cool riff so I wrote a song but the problem was we were nearly done recording the record when I finished writing the song for our came back in the students like hey we still have time to record that song and Ben didn't know it so we just jammed it and but while doing that we knew this it's a strong song it has potential to be the first single because it has the classic rock and roll good time feeling and yeah we were we are happy that me like could make it to the end with that money so it's nice humble oh this is the first song that I've heard from you where you're playing slide guitar oh yeah do you have you have fun planes like gets out of that I like the sound yeah yeah Joey about how have you like that filming it you feel about slide your thumb it's a was a very big challenge because I've never did it but like Brighton the song I knew that I have to place like a turn that one it just has to be there and so I fooled around a little with open tunes and found open G which fitted good for that song yeah just practice a little in the studio and jammed around a little and you took the best parts of it there you go that's check three on a new record partner in crime is very experimental I feel from the new rose very different direction let us know why you went this way with the direction in the album and the song specifically you know our over 60 songs for this record and we have so many different styles we had come free veloped to very aggressive kersey screamy stuff everything in between and partner in crime was one of those songs that we weren't sure about to the very end of the recordings but then we started playing in life you know get me get me feel it and it was such a great feeling so great about that song and we played a community every show and that's always good indication for for the right tre the right track so yeah we put it on the record and now it fits in perfectly i think and it gives us the opportunity for the future to go separate ways and crazy ways maybe an experimental I'm really happy we picked that song for fits great even though it's in a different direction i love it the album title why did you choose this one for the title we were thinking about a couple of titles for example partner in crime is one possible title for the record because we we got very close during this year's tour and we thought it might be cool but dead ends boys kind of really expresses our roots in classic rock and blues and southern rock and we wanted to make clear where we come from especially because we did a couple of experiments on this record and we want to make sure that this is come from fourth in the awkward of the the shows what this is yeah that was very important for us which is play hard and rock out so this is your first fictional story as well as the fictional character that you've done it's a story how was that singing your first fictional story or riding your first fictional story it was very excited to me and there was a big step for me because I was yeah usually you just write down what you what you experience yourself or looking witness along the way but this time I just wanted to make up something totally new and it's cool because it has a start of it has an end and it's like a little movie put into one song it's more like a soundtrack with the story book at the same time it was very exciting yeah I'm definitely want to follow that road

People making babiessometimes just to escape In this land of competitionthe compassion is gone Yet we ignore the needyand we keep pushing on... keep pushing on This is just a punk rock song Written for the peoplewho can see something's wrong Like ants in a colony we do our share But there's so many otherfuckin' insects out there, and this is just a punk rock song Have you visited the quagmire?Have you swam in the shit? The party conventions and the real politic The faces always different,the rhetoric the same But we swallow it all,and we see nothing change, nothing has changed This is just a punk rock song Written for the peoplewho can see something's wrong Like workers in a factory we do our share But there's so many otherfuckin' robots out there, and this is just a punk rock song 10 million dollars on a losing campaign20 million starving and writhing in pain Big strong people unwilling to giveSmall in vision and perspective One in five kids below the poverty lineOne population runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time This is just a punk rock song Written for the peoplewho can see something's wrong Like ants in a colony we do our share But there's so many otherfuckin' insects out there, and this is just a punk rock song Figures don't lie they speak of human disease But we do what we want andwe think what we please One in five kids below the poverty lineOne population runnin' out of time This is just a punk rock song (x3) Subtitle made byZsolt Kodner"

OCEAN HILLS - Death Or Liberty (2020) _ Official Music Video _ AFM Records, this bat song and I'm here with Joe Lee from ocean Hills thank you from pioneer town California and the yucca valley  you thanks for doing this brother oh man it's good to see you it's always so it's funny how all this comes together because I tried out for Velvet Revolver after Scott left and over the time you guys are maybe looking for maybe another singer and um I wrote this song and I sent it to you guys and didn't work out for one reason or another and then this song that we're gonna it is going to be one of our songs on the new album for ocean Gil's on afm records which the video was shot like ten minutes from here [Applause] that's cool so that won't be the the next video on the next released cause they've given us five release five videos the other one's a little bit more up-tempo traditionally in the old days we'd go with the up-tempo that's why I was kind of Lina this one because the way of the world why not yeah a little bit of like like that jeez yeah I'll go with the lyric so I understand that you know I just I just cut it won't back down cut rice and it's you that's great I did it for this hospital and not in Brazil that I'm a part of down that I hope that this charity down there but uh lyrically that was like okay I get that and I won't back down you know any me so I would say lyrically yeah  yeah they're both great I mean I think you know now with fans releasing singles it's almost like bam bam you don't have to wait this window anymore you just start releasing music and give people a lot like if you remember the last majolica they were putting out a video like every couple of weeks they just pretty much presented the record in the content form right that's like here and and that record ended up selling a million copies for a modern-day record that's a lot of records  his interest in your grandmother's piano is behind us and we record the whole album the album's called Santa Monica we call the record the whole grab album at my grandmother's house because it's a two hundred year old home mm-hmm it's um the walls are about two feet thick the floor is wooden and there's sand underneath the house uh and I was reading up on Rick Rubin the way he did it and he would take these houses that were awesome and really heavy and gnarly built and uh it's one of the best selling albums I've ever been on yeah you know I mean so well we're in a hangar right now this is an old helicopter hangar and then we we have another house up the hill that you were at that we actually built the studio in an old garage and I got a killer drum sound in there so we've created another studio up the hill that Billy Gibbons is coming out here and I've been trying to get him to come because I love getting people away from distractions like you hear about the old bands in England going to get in a castle or they're gonna go to the bomb and so they're gonna go to the south of France throwing stones when they did exon on Main Street right it went to France they only rented a shot totally I'll live together and that was Rick Rubin's theory - lets get the band together let's get a living together let's feel the energy right so that was the idea when I finally got Billy out here it was like the cell phone service isn't very good number one that's great right so we're like oh no one can get ahold of me okay that's good right or like we're working or I'm creating and living together in a way so as you know when you're with the band like that and I always say to people the earliest version of the band's recordings always the best why is the first two albums great of any band Aerosmith stones stones made a lot of great records you know but certain bands only have two great records right well before they got the money when they were all living together and probably some little apartment or they were like a family a team a gang you know and then came all the fortune and fame and what happens then well band's breakup and you know they start fighting so conceptually that was the idea about bringing Billy out who's a guy that made so many amazing records in the seventies and ZZ Top sergeants 1969 all the way through their resurgence in the eighties and now they have a legacy so they just continue but so he's coming and we're gonna record it's great it's awesome  there's a lot of really great drummers in the world right but for me as a drummer my my thing was to serve the song I'm I'm here to serve the song it's not about me I'm like I'm a team player I'm like this is a band and everybody especially in Guns N'Roses was contributing melodies slash played incredible melodies on the guitar those solos were worked out that just wasn't him shredding oh he thought about where that was going to take people emotionally and then the bass lines are created underneath were very much more into the League of like Paul McCartney if you're listening to the Beatles the one of the lead instruments is the base and then Axel's lyrics but with Izzy Stratton's lyrics were the things that really brought the band out of sort of Harrah metal if you will because it had more of a connection to the street and to the average person that could understand what was happening lyrically because you know Axl was a kid from Indiana you know he grew up tough grew up not rich you know lower middle class and so he was speaking to the middle of America and what when they opened welcome to the jungle on him getting off the Greyhound bus with a piece of wheat in his mouth right here's a kid coming and searching for his dream he's going to Hollywood and he meets the drug dealer on the street member yeah hello and that really happened to Axl so everything that Axl wrote about he was telling his story and I I would say this about singers and singers that I've been fortunate to be in bands with every piece of life that he lived you could feel in the music because he lived a pretty interesting life before he became a famous rock star and same with slash slash grew up in a very artistic family his mother was David Bowie's clothing designer and his father did record covers for Joni Mitchell a bunch of amazing artists Roxy Music was his mother in in The Jeffersons is that no Alan excuse me complaining Kravitz yeah so anyway slash grew up in a very creative environment Duff came from punk rock like you know so all the elements of the band and here I was a kid from Orange County loved progressive rock right and I loved but I loved bands like deep purple and but I still liked Genesis but and all the pieces of the puzzle all these different influences brought sound  I know you gotta run because you have a session tonight but I was wondering if we get some air outside and you can tell me how the read I heard that the reason the Black Album came to be is because you said some of the large yeah you
One Hidden Frame - 'Program Deceit',hello and welcome to another Escott session today we have one hidden frame they are probably one of the best Finnish punk rock bands and personally one of the best punk bands have ever seen life so this session is not going to disappoint this know how to play so enjoy one hidden frame  [Applause]    yes    I       [Applause]                            one hidden frame thank you very much for doing this thank you for having me in your rehearsing place in lapa danke and well the band started in 2002 seventeen years ago we had the first first first rehearsal yeah what were your influences when you started like I have to say it was like well adhesive satanic surfers of course I mean and then of course this old band from La Perla called Project and for dreaming and by religion of course was the main thing even though we don't sound like better - maybe but it's it's definitely one of the I would have to say I'm sorry I'm I was the only one back then this group this Neutron is for you also when was the was the first concert and how did it go it was in 2003 and it was in an old slaughterhouse in lapa Rhonda it was this kind of squat that's not really common in Finland yeah good night any limit so the years it was the basement of the and he used to have the you know the there hanging hooks where they hang the meat downstairs it was the first show yep really nervous because I was never meant to sing in front of anyone so yeah I don't know maybe you were there yeah he he didn't play back then but you saw you saw them was it good [Laughter] you played a couple of weeks ago opening for Satanic surfers how was the tonight for you guys well it was sure it was really overwhelming because it's something for us like that we listen to when we were young I don't the whole whole night was like really kind of surreal and a lot of beer talking about legendary Swedish punk bands think Beca well in the band you were involved in bringing adhesive to Helsinki for the first time you could tell us like how how did it came about getting addressed here yeah adhesive was one of the first bands for me like like 97 or something I heard then Wes who used to listen to them as well and and they quit in 2002 when we started so they came back in 2017 so and everyone was like they should come to Finland well why not just booked them by ourselves so I got in contact and I was a bit nervous because I never done shows like with someone I don't know like or I haven't met personally and their point was to make money for the charity so it was kind of like what if everything goes wrong and we don't get any money for the charity so it's everything so good yes that they to remember remember eight that they came back and all the money that they made it was donated to Doctors Without Borders yes yes so well that's cool you're recording a lot of plans so maybe you can also give some insight like maybe you heard some Finnish skate punk or punk rock bands that that caught your attention yeah of course lately I've been mixing for example never learned from all they send me their material and asked me talking to test mix problem it was okay and they approved me so that was good so I would say there's a good good kind of like a wave of skate punk going on so it's really nice to be a part of it is there any country you haven't played that you're looking forward to play well Spain I would say of course but I'm really looking forward to like Japan and like cannot Canada for like Ontario and Quebec area it really looks like a good area to play every night scene yeah yeah interested on trying to see how like a one hidden frame strong it's done like maybe from the beginning and and so I would like to get the the the example of a song that I've listened a lot because I was grateful enough to do the music video for exploding head syndrome so thank you so I don't know you could explain me like for example that's wrong how does it come about like that it start like the jam or a grief for a melody well unfortunately it doesn't start with the Cham I would love it to start with the chamber I don't know the situation of everyone's lives there are 20s anymore living in different cities and so the kind of the only option is to just to make riffs back home and send it to each other it starts with a maybe a beat or a riff or something just builds around it I don't know and then we rehearse it and it actually doesn't change that much in the studio of course some modifications regarding to the background vocals or something like that that but not to the main point of the song it is usually as effective as a figure but he is the main guy doing the backing local arrangements and and like like figuring out the big picture because I'm too lazy for that so it's a great combination to have him aboard in simple English Becca does it all for that for that song for exploding head syndrome what like the inspiration for the lyrics at the time it has a lot of things about you know bigotry the internet discussion about how everyone's blaming the immigration it has stuff about about the Turkish president like building big palaces at the same time as everyone's gaping to the refugee camps like where you put the money and well your latest 7-inch split together with the Italians Thousand Oaks how did that came about we met with Alex of Thousand Oaks in  holiday and in the week we started talking we could go to Rome one day we went and we realized we are we have really similar musical tastes not not just skate punk but you have everything else is well combined and then we thought like why wouldn't we never done in his bleep albums or or even the shorter releases so we thought why not do a split and Alex also does studio stuff in Rome so then we thought maybe we go there and we worked out well we recorded everything there one day actually actually it was one a half day in the evening we did the crunch for a couple of hours and then the next day guitars and bass and actually we recorded the vocals here yeah so it was a like a combined worked out really great and fast Alex what are the future plans for one hidden frame well well I'd like to maybe I don't know not say goodbye this guy here but he doesn't make a dent doesn't want to make a big fuss about it but but he joined in 2006 so but you know let's go how they go and you don't always have time for and we want to do a lot of shows abroad so so we're gonna do little switch here right yeah the future plans like to go outside Europe I guess yeah but in Japan and I think they try to take care of Spain because you know everyone in Spain yeah it's a recording it's been busy oh yeah I'm gonna have to start making new songs I guess that's the main reason yep let's see let's go Becca yes Emil thank you very much for doing this thank you for having us here and then thanks for the decoration who looks it the illumination it looks really good so when I wish you all the best then hope you go to Japan and I hope you go to Spain someday yeah okay well thank you thank you yep thanks hey thanks for watching and well you can find one hidden frame you know digital platforms and that split DP that we were talking about with Thousand Oaks if you want the physical copy you can get it from past decade records I'll leave a link in the comment section and what go support the band's thanks for watching and see you in the next one ah and please subscribe

waterweed - Beyond the ocean (Music Video),"I got finished the work quickly,and hurried back to home I looked sideways worn out instrumentas packed my excited feeling into the backpack When the car pick me up,raise my eyes, it still dark the sun is sleeping yet I know everythingThis is a little bit news for you But this is a great event for me I know everythingThis is a little bit tour for me But this new step absolutely glowing I was impressed by the first landscape I was confused by the first words I was exhausted by the first smell I remembered my hometown by the first taste I promised reunion by the first warmth Unreliable Wi-Fi at airport The message which we exchange awkwardly Going to meet up at small smoking place At last I could meet them and felt relieved I know everythingThis is a little bit news for you But this is a great event for me I know everythingThis is a little bit tour for me But this new step absolutely glowing I was impressed by the first landscape I was confused by the first words I was exhausted by the first smell I remembered my hometown by the first taste I promised reunion by the first warmth Beyond the ocean"
waterweed - July 31 (Music Video),"I wanted to share a stage someday since when I listened to your voice for the first time I was waiting such a day from east asia far away this is my ideal place California My dream didn't come true You've gone more far away That the day I listen to your song over and over many times Still I wanna hear more new song Still I wanna see sight of you singing I've always been encouraged by your melody I was always longing for your voice As the time pass, I will go your place someday, can you play song with me? At that time, then can you tell me about Fiona? Won't you be my friend? My dream didn't come true You've gone more far away That the day I listen to your song over and over many times Still I wanna hear more new song Still I wanna see sight of you singing As the time pass, I will go your place someday, can you play song with me? At that time, then can you tell me about Fiona? Won't you be my friend? Uncountable masterpieces which you made are always in our heart In the same way as that day I keep playing the songs until the day comes I wanted to share a stage someday since when I listened to your voice for the first time I was waiting such a day from east asia far away this is my ideal place California"

Yellowcard - Southern Air (+ Lyrics & HQ_HD Audio) [New Album Summer 2012],bottoms up tonight i drink to you and i cause with the morning comes the rest of my life and with this empty class i will break the past cause with the warning i can open my eyes i want this to be my awakening so i give this one to you an anthem full of truth i tell you now an epic tale of what you put me through and even though you don't deserve one of your own a melody a song about the life that you let go i can't believe that i still care enough i will break the past i want this to be my awakening yes i'll miss you still and probably always will i'm living with a busted heart that at least you know that i still care enough they say forgive me if i try to change forgive me comes the rest of my life i want this to be my awakening this is a story full of we were it burns here in this angel city lights will shine every good thing we were born fun another million miles to go we were born to be the ones to show the faith to share the faith the surface of the sun i think i have everything i need it got dark but now i think i see the world around is full of arms still reaching out to me i hear the notes and belt them back to you i feel loved i'm burning confused i'm not afraid cause i know i've got nothing left to lose i know that i have always i wish i could rewind i know make it up i love you still i always i love you still i always will away make it up it's always if i could write to the kid i was before i tell him you'll get everything you ever and when they give up cause they will give up say here i am this is supposed to be if i could write to myself when i was on top of it that you deserve the worst they say you're never you just so many people close to me cut me but here i am and when they give up cause they will give up say here i am alive they say you don't grow up you just grow old it's safe to say this is here i am if i could write to the kid i was before i took a flight headed north i wasn't waiting anymore and tore it all down i wanted to show you the depth of this that dream always known but i would lose everything when you came the one where i see you and fall finally i sleep i've always run right through the moment i wanted to show you finally sleeping me with me let me say this first i was on your side before the war began my gloves came off when the ring went on you can tune me out you can turn me down and try to cut me off but you will not stop me singing i want you to know i'm not us to is you're allowed to win even when you're wrong you still keep cause all on talent lies i want you to know i'm not sorry at all oh the beat kept getting faster and you lost control can't buy forgiveness i we i've been here a while staring at the screen wondering what i'll write things i can't explain but should have tried to say when i had the time that you were inspirational let's just keep driving on all the stars let's go i remember how like a telescope you could always find something worth a wish i can't understand why um let's not go those were the days when we laughed is my only hope is are we from those were the days is hope you're my telescope so here i go again another leap of faith i close my eyes and wait to fall i see a future in which i will soon become the only truth you know at what i'm all i think about back then back when we built something new the world was ours to conquer and we were not afraid i miss you madly and it's raining on the coast these numbers i think about back then back when we built something and we were new afraid to lose to that was back then back when we built something new the world was ours to conquer and we were not afraid to lose away somewhere in sadness you changed two three four i found out in the fall i've been gone on the road for a year she said honey i've got real bad news and then there were just tears and we would never be the same again since then i've often wondered what you might have been like how it would have felt to hold you would you have had my eyes don't you think we would have been best friends you would not be driving you to school you would tell all your friends that you thought i you would was all the love in my heart we were 22 years young then breaking rules all around it felt like it was never gonna end both so lost and crazy we were i never got to meet you my best friend you would be 10 and i'd be driving you to school you would tell all your friends that you thought i was cool you would be out in the sun until it be was star wars all the love in my heart i've watched the world go by outside a window i still can't believe where i am now but not let down cause i have found a gravity a voice that pulls me to my knees this here i am this will always be the sun lays down inside the ocean i'm right where i belong feel the air the salts on my skin the future's coming on and after living through these wild stop years for a while breathe it in and i the only truth i know this will always be heard so this southern air is in my lungs it's in every word i've sung seems the only truth i know this will always be home you

flows really well the fact that d-box got such a very like soft almost voice like i mean yeah there's a lot of archery into it but it's very soft ways things a little bit high pitch and then central c comes out with this proper law rough advice rough accent so i had to bash i almost thought about getting a cab back do it like recon video that if we upload it probably get some backlash back shot she got the ripple effect it's too tempted i can't help but slap that [¬†__¬†] that pull up i don't wanna be a dad yet plan b girl you gotta swallow that tablet the way that she handle it this one talented pom-pom soaking for like i'm paddling back come round i'm a fan of it right on the back one time and sadly hey yo a doctor working wonders damn that's a big circumference get away she don't need no lube on the 40th floor you should see the views all right she don't wanna send me a [¬†__¬†] on snapchat madman i don't wanna leak your news how do i say about seeming rude i just wanna see if it's cute shake that back like a video vixen this one hit on i just find it so funny how there's no meaning to this to this verse at all in this lightest yeah if i see anyone listening to they'll be like yeah like they'll just be fully rapping along i find that soft on it i just want to see if it's cute shake that back like a video vixx and this one he don't want to be in my tune she want to go nobu just for the snap if i pay for the tab you best eat your food on the road you want to go novo just for the snap but if i'm paying b better eat your food the fact that girls are like known to just care so much about social media where they'll be snapping everything taking pictures of their food but he's like if i'm paying you better be eating that don't just come here for the for the picture you wanna go no view just for the snap if i pay for the tubby best eat your food on the ground get 100 to show this whole one see if it's true posting she don't want to be the squares no more she says she wanna be the goose before she got hack it not actively smoking now she wanna leave the room but yeah just started right now i'm looking for cribs the smooth transition like now she wanna leave the room the year just started right now i'm looking for cribs overseas i'm giving my ladies some driving lessons in a hundred grand jeep when you see me in public no falls man i need some privacy  i'm just pure vibing with his voice can we just talk about it like i i can't like fathom how he's got so much attitude on his voice but i genuinely like it like i'm not the biggest fan of things like travis scott because i think there's so much autotune on his voice that i don't like even know what he's saying i'm like little baby i like him but at the same time so much autumn i like the fact that d blocks just a bit lower than that he's not got that much autumn but he also knows like how he's gonna the melody of his song like it's a general song it's not like pure rapping or anything and it's important if you knew the truth by that [¬†__¬†] don't never get awkward and i know that [¬†__¬†]   i like that little bit of like it's almost talking it sounds like he's talking on the phone but like it kind of ends the transition before he goes on to then the next verse the chorus when you see me in public no falls man i need some privacy please the best part of this song at the moment i'm actually vibing with it it's so catchy and the melody is spot on i love it see the drake's outside now i'm flashing the world on the toilet richard milia cripped by the poor and it's important if you knew the truth by that [¬†__¬†] then it would get awkward it's always like the idea where the student comes becomes better than the master like i knew that guy would get money but i was the one that taught him i was the one that got him where he isn't he's the one with the money like the student becomes better than the master than the one who taught him and i know that [¬†__¬†] get money now i'm the [¬†__¬†]  [Applause] that was actually a banging song you know i've never had a problem with d block europe i genuinely like him although i don't listen to british raps so much i still enjoy british rap if that makes sense i just don't go out my way to listen to it but i have heard d block europe a lot of times and i've got a lot of their songs downloaded on my playlist so i did actually like this song central c was a new one i don't genuinely listen to central c at all but yeah what do you guys think of this song let me know in the comments below if there's some americans out there what do you guys think of british rap do you prefer it over american rape 
Dave - Clash (ft. Stormzy), silent mode my guy's on riding mode zombie survival mode he's got a new investment pop that showed no microphone i'll ride for bro he's next to i like typing all the sport five     birthday game    we just walked downstairs    the shortest one on my mind  one you
Digga D - Energy (Official Video),foreign      foreign  who knows please   please don't ruin my energy I heard it why you keep telling me I've gotta protect my energy with the streets I've gotta protect my energy too much jealousy I see a friend to an enemy please about    thank you next time
Digga D - STFU (Official Video),did I just hit you are now locked in to crossover media  if you never went chill you'll be in the middle by binge I call even though guys   this one is sounding different this one sound like they got something to prove no this is what Freedom sounds like this is what Freedom sounds like that's exactly oh guys this is what Freedom sounds like this is a different level of energy in his voice right now and the color grading when it's cold water for an editor color ready   did I just hit I feel like I just heard vocals in the back let's run this back first of all this one is standing out in Vegas catalog over but I haven't had a chance to listen to the project let me know if y'all want to see me react to Naughty by Nature I'd have listened to anything from it I have all those videos still saved because I want to actually check it out let me know if y'all want to see me do a reaction to that one but this sounds like he just has something to prove I don't know how else to put it than that like he he just completely flipped up his sign a little bit right there this little small things he's doing a little bit different I haven't heard him layer his voice the way that he's doing here I haven't heard him do albums the way he's doing here the things here that I would think of other artists when I think of these kind of elements and Digger this took a 50 that made it his own now this doesn't feel like the Diggity I'm familiar with that's one of the things that I appreciate about him and why I think he has longevity in the scene and why he does so well he constantly elevates his son he evolves with every stage and phase of his life he doesn't just stick in one particular Lane and just stays there and that's something you have to give him some credit for nothing  so just the fact I hear that the vocal cross is coming up just the fact that he had high energy to open up and he's but right back down so there's no energy right here and he's still giving you the same like feeling when you listen to her it's that same kind of oomph but he's shown he could be nonchalant he could be nonchalant with it and he can be a little more aggressive with it even his aggression still has a little bit of like a chole laid backness to it at the same time but at the same truth if we drop my [¬†__¬†] kill off future I'm gripping a spin on pull by the hammer kick on the tricks  foreign  there's so much going on here first of all the rudeness the censoring the vocals even though Digger did his time assuming it's his vocals on this could hear what he did with Glee I'm assuming it's his vocals on this Billy or Chubbs would have sent this one I can already hear their voices I can already hear that yeah like  I'm in love with violence violence more what's this trident all of them know but they're keeping the silence Rock always we gonna retirement already hiding in my mind finding them night next night with Integrity even when they're begging me I didn't beat for none of them or you're gonna have somebody got fun again  I can't focus there's so much going on here one thing I have to say do is this whole debate between always who's better lyrically Digga KO when I really started exploring Digger's discography and relisting I'm gonna say I give him credit because he really he really he'd be saying some stuff I can't lie this isn't sounding like his best lyrical performance at least based off what I'm hearing right now it seems like he's just wanted to make a point he just wanted to say some stuff because he gets himself his chest or whatever he just wanted to just be rude right and just be his normal aggressive aggressive self doesn't like you shouldn't approve anything in terms of his Artistry he was just trying to whatever right but his flows that's one thing that's consistent I'm gonna Digger across every single song his flows are always air tight there are artists whose clothes that I love been every once in a while still have a little bit of something I can point out about it Digger so far isn't really one of those rappers where I could say he has spotty moments with his flow that's that's one thing he's really very consistent about it I'm in love with violence violence more what's this tried on all of them know but they're keeping aside on the boots you need some guy to call me game you don't fit they're a crime obviously going with time already hiding in my one finding them 9x9 I'm a man with Integrity even when they're begging me I did a beef with none of them oh you're gonna hand somebody go run again free v15 I'll stop it stop it stop it's a habit made my head get hot I'll grab it I don't mean to be rude but it's all 22 if you got a shotgun  standing so I hate them sticks my name straight Shane if I pick up I guess nowadays it's gonna hold minimum sick can't be hands off man's hands on with his hand gone bang one of them  he's even really saying much right it's not to discredit Digger as a rapper obviously he's that's how I feel my guy he's everybody's saying much by his standard we've heard what Digger can do when he really wants to get in his bag with his pen what he's doing here he is showing you how he can glide on a beat and this beat is also very very cold super simple but something about it this perfectly matches the tone that he's setting it isn't too bright to the point where it's like it's just creating a clash in terms of what he's delivering but at the same time it isn't that super dark gritty kind of throwback drove feeling either it has just that perfect combination that perfect balance to it I think that's something that's really cool I'll grab it I don't mean to be rude but it's all 22 if you got a shotgun  so I hate them sticks my name is  he switched his flow in the middle of flowing they went right back I'm gonna see if I can point it out because the way he did it was just too much games  right he said hands on with it and then he went right back to the floor he was delivering right before that those are the little things son people one more time listen to the flow   those little things that you can do to just add another bit of oomph to your song and make it stand out just a little those are the small things I look for now because at this stage in the game everybody can get a crazy beat everybody can throw a nice you know metaphor a nice similar punchline in there these are the little things that you can do to get a little bit of accentuation right the things you do with your vocals the thing that you do that's hilarious voice the the changes in your tone right I'm hearing a little bit of like unknown tea kind of styling in terms of like playing with different levels in his voice he's showing you the vocals he's doing so much in this which is showing kind of like his Evolution as an artist I just wish maybe it was a little bit more more of his penmanship in here I think this one doesn't really do himself Justice we'll do us his penmanship but it does stand out in his catalog  again Billy with a sentence  with a sentence OD you know I didn't get to react to it early but shout out to groundwork's First sending me this video early appreciate it nonetheless but this was cold it was interesting it's very interesting very interesting yeah very interesting is there anything enough for the four seconds right calm beat I think this one was cool I'm definitely enjoying this one I really don't think this is Digger's best performance again with regards to his penmanship but it does show how much he's grown musically the beat selection is calm I love the beat it has the drill aspects to my face even if you took out the slides it still would match like this didn't have to be drill per se but it complemented Digger style very well but it also still stands out and of itself it has a little bit of a grimy feeling with regards to some of the samples in there I think that's one of the things I really love about this V2 and why it's so memorable to me but overall I think this is one of those that should play just to chill Vibe out too but the same time doesn't push too many of diggers boundaries it isn't too rule it isn't too fun it isn't too lyrical but it is still very flowy I think that's one of the things that Digger is never gonna let up on NASA's flow anyway let me know in the comment section down below what are some of your favorite songs of Naughty by Nature let me know if you want me to react to it if you're new here my name is until next time peace thank you
